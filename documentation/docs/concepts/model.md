# Model

## Why is it important to trace models in the experimental phase?
- **Maintain Clarity**: With numerous iterations and experiments, it's easy to lose track of what changes were made and why. Tracing models with their input and output types and the model code helps maintain clarity and organization
- **Facilitate Comparisons**: Having a detailed record of each model allows you to compare their performance and behavior accurately. This comparison is vital for selecting the best model for your final implementation.
- **Ensure Reproducibility**: Reproducing results is a fundamental aspect of machine learning. Tracing models ensures that you can recreate any experiment if needed, providing a reliable reference for future work.
